# DAY 1

It's time for third task guys :) It won't be so easy :D so be prepared


TASK:
1) prepare project according to movie:
http://outgoingpoland.pl/javascript-60-days-challange/day-1/02%20-%20CSS%20+%20JS%20Clock.mp4
2) Try to impress me, add extra feature, something different.
- fix the problem which is mentioned in the end of movie
- try to upgrade clock and hands to be more fancy (add hours, modify hands), try to play with CSS(and images)
- extra feature can be different timezones, for example when I click New york button, clock will show me time in New York,
when i click Warsaw it will show again our timezone time.
- or add anything else :)

IMPORTANT:
From now we will change the way of commiting changes.
Everyone have to create new branch from master branch and when his task will be ready pull request should be send.

INSTRUCTION HOW to create and switch to new branch
1) git checkout -b <newBranchName>
   new branch name should follow such pattern:
   day<dayNumber>-<yourName> so for me command wil be:
   git checkout -b day1-bartek
2) git checkout day1-bartek - this will change actual branch to new one,
   to check if you are on correct branch just hit:
   git branch
3) to push changes
1) you can only change and add files inside your own folder.
2) create new folder with your name on the same level as folder 'bartek'
3) copy files from starter/files to your folder, sounds folder should stay,
don't copy sounds just refer to it inside your HTML file
4) make initial commit after setting all files
TEMPLATE FOR YOUR COMMIT NAMES
FIRST COMMIT - "{yourName} {day} - initial commit" - ex. "bartek day1 - inital commit"
NEXT COMMITS - "{yourName} {day} - {commitNumber} - ex. "bartek day1 - 1"
5) we're working on branch master, don't create new branches, in the future when you will aproach to next level we will
create more complex projects and we will split our work to few branches, everyone will have differen't feature to implement.
3) don't use any 3rd party libraries, to complete this task you need only vanilla JS

GOOD LUCK FUCKAROUNDERS :)
