# DAY 1

This is your first task, it will be very easy just for quick warm up, before DAY 2 :) so be ready fuckarounders :)
There won't be more time to fuck around if you know what i mean :)


TASK:
1) prepare project according to movie:
http://outgoingpoland.pl/javascript-60-days-challange/day-1/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit.mp4
2) Try to impress me, add extra feature, something different. For example when I press some key
instead of playing sound you can start playing some movie. If you want add movie to project files, make it very short (3-5s)

IMPORTANT:
1) you can only change and add files inside your own folder.
2) create new folder with your name on the same level as folder 'bartek'
3) copy files from starter/files to your folder, sounds folder should stay,
don't copy sounds just refer to it inside your HTML file
4) make initial commit after setting all files
TEMPLATE FOR YOUR COMMIT NAMES
FIRST COMMIT - "{yourName} {day} - initial commit" - ex. "bartek day1 - inital commit"
NEXT COMMITS - "{yourName} {day} - {commitNumber} - ex. "bartek day1 - 1"
5) we're working on branch master, don't create new branches, in the future when you will aproach to next level we will
create more complex projects and we will split our work to few branches, everyone will have differen't feature to implement.
3) don't use any 3rd party libraries, to complete this task you need only vanilla JS

GOOD LUCK FUCKAROUNDERS :)
DEADLINE for this task is 24.07.2017 23:59
