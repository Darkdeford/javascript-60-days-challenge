# DAY 1

It's time for second task guys :)


TASK:
1) prepare project according to movie:
http://outgoingpoland.pl/javascript-60-days-challange/day-1/02%20-%20CSS%20+%20JS%20Clock.mp4
2) Try to impress me, add extra feature, something different.
- fix the problem which is mentioned in the end of movie
- try to upgrade clock and hands to be more fancy (add hours, modify hands), try to play with CSS(and images)
- extra feature can be different timezones, for example when I click New york button, clock will show me time in New York,
when i click Warsaw it will show again our timezone time.
- or add anything else :)

IMPORTANT:
1) you can only change and add files inside your own folder.
2) create new folder with your name on the same level as folder 'bartek'
3) copy files from starter/files to your folder, sounds folder should stay,
don't copy sounds just refer to it inside your HTML file
4) make initial commit after setting all files
TEMPLATE FOR YOUR COMMIT NAMES
FIRST COMMIT - "{yourName} {day} - initial commit" - ex. "bartek day1 - inital commit"
NEXT COMMITS - "{yourName} {day} - {commitNumber} - ex. "bartek day1 - 1"
5) we're working on branch master, don't create new branches, in the future when you will aproach to next level we will
create more complex projects and we will split our work to few branches, everyone will have differen't feature to implement.
3) don't use any 3rd party libraries, to complete this task you need only vanilla JS

GOOD LUCK FUCKAROUNDERS :)
